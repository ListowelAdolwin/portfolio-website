            <h3>A bit of my journey</h3>
            <p> Okay, something small about me. I grew up in a family
                where no one had a computer. During my SHS days, My ICT teacher
                introduced my computing with his laptop.
                As I played games with it, I grew fonder of computers everyday.
                Yes, that was how it all started and now, I code everyday.
